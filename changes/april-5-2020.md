# Changelog  / Apr 5 2020

## UI

We have done some interesting changes to the UI in order to provide better user experience and usability for our solution.

### Progress
We have changed the way progress is tracked from being shown only in precentage (%) to be shown as entries done out of the total entries discovered for the running scan.

### Scan Configuration
We have added a section to view the configurations the scan was started with, this is helpful for copying and verifying scan configuration.

### PDF and Reporting

We improved the PDF generation functionality to add both the ability to select specific sections of the PDF you might want to generate, and also a new progress bar to show the PDF generation stages and remove the "waiting for unkown time" feeling.
